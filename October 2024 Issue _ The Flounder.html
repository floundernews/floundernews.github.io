Back in my day, we had a real classroom in a real school. Not this wishy-washy Google stuff you hear of today,' TDSB Congressman, age 86, says.</div> <div class="author">By: Mentie Brakedawn</div> <br> <figure> <img src="./October 2024 Issue _ The Flounder_files/2024-12-12-ban-google.jpg"> </figure> <p>TORONTO, ON– The TDSB has just recently announced their decision to ban all Google products– that includes the Google browser, Google Drive, and Google Classroom– from all TDSB Wi-Fi networks.</p> <p>This decision quickly follows the mandate to ban phones and social media in schools instituted by the TDSB at the start of this school year. It is regarded by many as the natural continuation of a campaign to reduce distracted students in the classroom.</p> <p>“Google browsers must generally access all online distractions on students’ computers. To go to any website, you need to do a Google search. Many websites have Google log-ins. Our policy would be removing all distractions at its root, resulting in a much more focused classroom,” A TDSB representative commented.</p> <p>Students will still be allowed to keep their laptops and Chromebooks, but the functionality of Chromebooks in particular will be greatly limited to whatever apps will be necessary for school (i.e. Microsoft Word). The devices will be transformed into “expensive paperweights”; but many administrators and teachers are in favour of this transition.</p> <p>“This policy is a good move,” one WLMAC teacher commented. “I’m so tired of students being on ‘Instant-gram’ and ‘Red-it’ in class. They’re getting distracted by Gmail and Google Slides, and there’s no valid reason for them to need this frivolousness. Now, it’ll be just like the good old days, with everything being on paper as originally intended.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, students did not have as much of a negative attitude to the policy as expected. One WLMAC student the Flounder interviewed said, “Yeah, it’s understandable why they’d do that. It’s okay though, I still have a VP- I mean what?”</p> <p>Other students, however, have compared this move by the TDSB to China’s Great Firewall, a comparison that administrators did not particularly appreciate.</p> <p>Only time will tell if this policy will increase the effectiveness of education in schools, or if it will spark a new era of student rebellion. For the time being, though, the TDSB plans its next steps of banning Wi-Fi entirely.</p> </div> <hr> <div id="lives-of-americas-elite" class="article-wrapper"> <h2>The Flounder Here, Your One and Only Source into the Scandalous Lives of America’s Elite <a class="external-link" href="https://flounder.news/2024/12/lives-of-americas-elite/"> <svg height="1em" width="1em" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 1000 1000" enable-background="new 0 0 1000 1000" xml:space="preserve"> <metadata> Svg Vector Icons : http://www.onlinewebfonts.com/icon </metadata> <g fill="currentColor"><g transform="translate(0.000000,511.000000) scale(0.100000,-0.100000)"><path d="M2921.9,4981.1c-216.4-57.4-408.5-220.8-499.1-424c-35.3-75.1-42-185.5-50.8-947.4l-11-861.3l-861.3-11c-819.3-11-865.7-13.3-960.6-57.4c-159-75.1-278.3-194.3-357.8-357.7l-72.9-148l-6.6-3146.9c-4.4-3142.5-4.4-3146.9,42-3299.3c39.7-132.5,66.3-172.2,183.3-291.5c119.2-117.1,159-143.5,291.5-183.3c152.4-46.4,156.8-46.4,3299.3-41.9l3146.9,6.6l148,72.9c163.4,79.5,282.7,198.8,357.8,357.8c44.2,95,46.4,141.3,57.4,960.6l11,861.3l861.3,11c819.3,11,865.7,13.3,960.6,57.4c159,75.1,278.3,194.3,357.8,357.7l72.9,148l6.6,3146.9c4.4,3142.5,4.4,3146.9-41.9,3299.3c-39.8,132.5-66.3,172.3-183.3,291.5c-117,114.8-161.2,143.5-287.1,183.3c-150.2,46.4-161.2,46.4-3257.3,44.2C3741.2,5009.8,2999.2,5003.2,2921.9,4981.1z M9151.7,1246.8v-3014.4H6137.3H3122.9v3014.4v3014.4h3014.4h3014.4V1246.8z M2372,16.7v-1972.1l64-132.5c75.1-156.8,192.1-280.5,344.5-360l110.4-59.6l1992-6.6l1994.2-4.4v-761.9v-761.9H3862.7H848.3v3014.4v3014.4h761.9H2372V16.7z"></path><path d="M5629.4,3477.2c-300.3-108.2-333.5-519-55.2-682.4c72.9-44.2,117-46.4,792.8-53l715.5-6.6L5887.8,1538.3C5064,712.3,4682,314.8,4657.7,259.6c-46.4-114.8-42-216.4,17.7-326.8c90.5-170,291.5-240.7,474.8-165.6c55.2,24.3,452.7,406.3,1278.7,1230.1l1196.9,1194.7l6.6-715.5c6.6-675.8,8.8-719.9,53-792.8c53-92.8,163.4-170,267.2-189.9c176.7-33.1,377.6,97.2,426.2,273.8c15.5,66.3,22.1,448.3,17.7,1280.9l-6.6,1185.9l-50.8,81.7c-28.7,44.2-88.3,103.8-132.5,132.5l-81.7,50.8l-1203.6,4.4C5923.1,3508.1,5702.2,3503.7,5629.4,3477.2z"></path></g></g> </svg> </a> </h2> <div class="description"> “Ronald Dump says he will ban being a Democrat upon being elected” - DJ Vance probably</div> <div class="author">By: The Flounder</div> <br> <p>As of late, we see our favourites, DJ Vance, Ronald Dump and Peelon Mask in the spotlight once more. Sources confirm what Y (formerly tweeter) users already know, there is no stopping Ronny from an opinion, a first amendment right for all American citizens!</p> <p>The European Onion, a fake news source according to Dumpy, has stated that they will set an arrest warrant for Peelon should he allow Ronny back onto the platform. “Wow, that’s crazy beef. Mans would never smoke their bredrins like that bro. Ronny ain’t gonna nize his beak to nun.” DJ, Ronny’s right hand man, said in a formal apology for his deleted tweets from 2016, calling Ronald ‘reprehensible’. After this old beef emerged once more between DJ and Ronald, DJ is adamant to stand up for Ronald through everything, showing him that he is worthy of being second in command.</p> <p>A previous ‘alliance’ between the EU and America, the group run by Ronny and DJ is said to have been put off, this squabble too much for them to handle. “I gotta put them back in their place. Got no reason to make my homie in trouble for speakin.”</p> <p>The trio of DJ, Ronald and Peelon has had a long history, with a DJ and Ronald being ops only 8 years ago. Peelon, on the other hand, has caused some controversy as of late, pressing others who whispered about him. It is unsure if the trio will last, with sources confirming that there is tension between the leaders.</p> <p>“I thought we were homies. Homies don’t do each other dirty like that, yo.

These videos have been widely viewed this past week, thanks to a decision by the TDSB to broadcast them in class to all elementary and middle school-aged students.</p> <p>These safety videos immediately exploded in controversy, due to their messaging to kids that accepting food from complete strangers at night is “perfectly safe” even without parental supervision. Initially, many parents and teachers believed these safety tips applied only for Halloween night, which most agreed was completely acceptable. However, SAFE representatives promptly responded otherwise.</p> <p>“Our video tips are obviously relevant year-round. After all, if they work for some random night in October, they should no doubt work all the time!” says SAFE security chief Tubi Trust-Ed.</p> <p>The widely contended messaging of these videos has led to the rise of parent group ‘Common Sense Limited’ (Common Sense Ltd.). This group is determined to force the board to “immediately halt the screening of these ridiculous and misleading videos”, as quoted by group leader, Trikatrit Frikandi.</p> <p>Ms. Frikandi further asserts, “What happened to the old ‘stranger danger’ message? Why on earth are we encouraging our kids to actively seek out and accept candy from complete strangers at night?”</p> <p>SAFE’s counterargument is simply that the classic ‘stranger danger’ attitude is out-of-date for today’s times. The organization’s chief advisor, Mr. E. Stranger, who has only been arrested twice for suspicious behaviour, insists that “kids just don’t talk to strangers enough these days - what a missed opportunity for these youth to meet new, totally completely well-meaning people.”</p> <p>He adds on, “And don’t just take it from us - our largest funder, ‘Suspicious Candy Corp,’ also supports our mission to make kids feel safer about nighttime snacking.”</p> <p>This sentiment is echoed by the school board as well. Board representatives explained that 127% of the yearly budget had been allocated to consultant fees (rather than textbooks or AC units) related to finding a suitable company to provide the safety tip videos. The consultant used, a part-time vampire, part-time wizard named Count Sus, advised the use of SAFE, and given the outrageous sum paid for this consulting service, TDSB reps claim that SAFE simply must be a reputable company.</p> <p>Currently, Common Sense Ltd. are attempting to take SAFE and the school board to court for promoting “extremely unsafe practices” to children, but are having difficulty amassing supporters due to what they call “a lack of common sense.” But for now, if you trust SAFE’s safety tips, then the only things you have to fear this Halloween season are some spooky ghosts (and maybe the odd vampire-wizard).</p> </div> </div> </main> <button class="scroll-to-top" title="Back to Top"> <img alt="Fish" src="./October 2024 Issue _ The Flounder_files/logo.svg"> </button> <footer class="site-footer"> <nav class="footer-nav"> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/">Home</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/about/">About</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://forms.gle/3bvsntMzJKumC4vJ8">Subscribe</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/random/">Random Article</a> </nav> <div class="aux-links"> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/Terms-of-Service/">Terms of Service</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/licenses/">Licenses</a> </div> <div class="socials"> <a class="social-link instagram" href="https://instagram.com/wlmac.floundernews" target="_blank" title="@wlmac.floundernews"></a> <a class="social-link facebook" href="https://facebook.com/macfloundernews" target="_blank" title="macfloundernews"></a> <a class="social-link email" href="mailto:thefloundernews@gmail.com" target="_blank" title="thefloundernews@gmail.com"></a> </div> <p>The Flounder</p> </footer>

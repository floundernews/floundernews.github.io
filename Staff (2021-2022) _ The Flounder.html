She has a fear of expectations. She expected this bio to be done weeks ago.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Di Hu</h2> <h4 class="team">Vice President</h4> <p class="bio">Many would describe Di as a casual cynic. Little do they know that he is, in fact, a competitive cynic.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Aidan Wang</h2> <h4 class="team">Writer</h4> <p class="bio">Aidan joined the Flounder because he wanted to be a funnier person. Only later did he discover that people already laugh at him constantly.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Hassan Khan</h2> <h4 class="team">Writer</h4> <p class="bio">Hassan joined so many writing clubs that it has turned into a problem. He claims he can stop at any time and that he has everything under control, but we don't really believe him.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Justin Zhu</h2> <h4 class="team">Writer</h4> <p class="bio">Justin Z is not to be confused with Justin L or justice. Although, Justin is an embodiment of justice, going so far as to demand more free samples at Costco. WHY IS THE LIMIT ONLY 5 PER PERSON? LET ME HAVE MORE. Professionally, Justin writes about why he should be unbanned from Costco and works on the Flounder on the side.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Kevin Pham</h2> <h4 class="team">Writer</h4> <p class="bio">Kevin Pham joined the Flounder to learn how to start telling the truth. This worked a bit too well and the only thing he does now is write rants about how world leaders are actually lizard people.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Patrick Lin</h2> <h4 class="team">Writer</h4> <p class="bio">Patrick joined the Flounder to make people laugh. He would if his vocabulary didn’t consist of just “sus” and “amogus”.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Paul Lee</h2> <h4 class="team">Writer</h4> <p class="bio"></p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Artemis Chen</h2> <h4 class="team">Writer</h4> <p class="bio">At the height of her powers, with the stroke of a pen, the Goddess, Artemis could will realities into existence. Now, she only writes for the most factual newspaper in the realm, the Flounder.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Alyn Huang</h2> <h4 class="team">Illustrator</h4> <p class="bio">this is so sad alexa play despacito</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Yujin Bae</h2> <h4 class="team">Illustrator</h4> <p class="bio">Yujin is incredibly artistic, being a very good illustrator and also playing the flute. It is suspected that she may be behind the attempted formation of a Flounder Concert Band. It failed due to a lack of being publicly known.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Rose Moosavian</h2> <h4 class="team">Illustrator</h4> <p class="bio">Rose is a wonderful illustrator for the flounder. When asked to talk a lot little about herself, she said "I can't remember...My life...I remember being very...Purple...I love...illustrations...and comics...Spread joy through my art and...A bird."</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Lois Zan</h2> <h4 class="team">Illustrator</h4> <p class="bio">As the third-strongest staff member, Lois was unwillingly subsumed into the Flounder like a single-celled organism engulfing the precursor to the mitochondria. Instead of providing life-giving energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate, she gives us pretty pictures as an illustrator.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Fatma Jadoon</h2> <h4 class="team">Illustrator</h4> <p class="bio">I know nothing about this person. Fatma does illustrations, I think. I’ve heard that she’s the third-strongest person on the Flounder, but I can’t personally attest. Rumor has it her horoscope told her to join.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Tracy Wang</h2> <h4 class="team">Illustrator</h4> <p class="bio">Tracy, as her name suggests, is an incredible tracer, able to copy her own drawings! The Flounder never realized this when she applied and got her position as illustrator. Background checks are important.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Avery Mai</h2> <h4 class="team">Illustrator</h4> <p class="bio">Not a layout professional. Signed up for the wrong job due to failing English since elementary school.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Alexandra Dang</h2> <h4 class="team">Editor</h4> <p class="bio">Due to the many Alexs in Mackenzie, no one knows who is which. It's rumored that they're all actually just one person switching identities. Nevertheless, one of these identities is an excellent editor for the Flounder.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Eric Jin</h2> <h4 class="team">Editor</h4> <p class="bio">After the incident in 1999, what is now Eric changed his name and swore his soul to the Flounder. In exchange for protection, he would eternally serve the almighty blowfish.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Adam Chen</h2> <h4 class="team">Editor</h4> <p class="bio">Adam spends more time editing than writing. After his work is done, the poor writers often find their articles completely changed. Except for the last sentence, which Adam fears would make the article incomprehensible.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Avery Lee</h2> <h4 class="team">Layout Designer</h4> <p class="bio">Professional carpooler, amateur artist. Forced to make comics for both the Lyon and the Flounder as a double agent.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Roseanna Liang</h2> <h4 class="team">Layout Designer</h4> <p class="bio">One day, Roseanna showed up to the Flounder and started desiging layouts. We had no idea where she came from, but keep her around anyways. Roseanna can be frequently heard mumbling about that one thing in her past life and how she’ll eventually get it after she finishes deconstructing the laws of physics.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Erin Elridge</h2> <h4 class="team">Layout Designer</h4> <p class="bio">Tiring of endlessly designing graphics for the Lyon, Erin decided to expand her skillset and step onto the Flounder, where she now designs graphics. Truly the third-strongest Flounder member. Just goes to show, you never know where you’ll end up in life!</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Vicky Zhang</h2> <h4 class="team">Layout Designer</h4> <p class="bio">Vicky is a layout designer for the Flounder. Some items on her bucket list include travelling to Antarctica, skydiving, and attending the Oscars as a seat filler. She's got quite the adventure laid out!</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Peter Ye</h2> <h4 class="team">Web Developer</h4> <p class="bio">Aside from developing the Flounder's website, Peter also enjoys inline skating. One day, he hopes to complete an entire inline skating marathon, but for now, he'll be floundering in development purgatory.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Leyang Zou</h2> <h4 class="team">Web Developer</h4> <p class="bio">Hailing from the bottom of the attendance list, Leyang Zou is a passionate developer for the Flounder. As a self-proclaimed avid reader, he considers the Java documentation to be a tear-jerking modern literary masterpiece.</p> </div><div class="member"> <h2 class="name">Diana Lin</h2> <h4 class="team">Social Media</h4> <p class="bio">Without our social media person Diana single-handedly alerting you to our existence incessantly and futilely, you may not have ever heard of us. We’re sorry for not letting that happen; that’s our bad. While the third-strongest member of the Flounder team, she’s the first-strongest typist.</p> </div></section> </div> </main> <button class="scroll-to-top" title="Back to Top"> <img alt="Fish" src="./Staff (2021-2022) _ The Flounder_files/logo.svg"> </button> <footer class="site-footer"> <nav class="footer-nav"> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/">Home</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/about/">About</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://forms.gle/3bvsntMzJKumC4vJ8">Subscribe</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/random/">Random Article</a> </nav> <div class="aux-links"> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/Terms-of-Service/">Terms of Service</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/licenses/">Licenses</a> </div> <div class="socials"> <a class="social-link instagram" href="https://instagram.com/wlmac.floundernews" target="_blank" title="@wlmac.floundernews"></a> <a class="social-link facebook" href="https://facebook.com/macfloundernews" target="_blank" title="macfloundernews"></a> <a class="social-link email" href="mailto:thefloundernews@gmail.com" target="_blank" title="thefloundernews@gmail.com"></a> </div> <p>The Flounder</p> </footer>

You’re reaching into your backpack as your teacher taps her foot angrily and holds a clipboard tightly to her chest, a disappointed expression already making way. You push your arm around wildly, pulling out loose papers and shaking your head when you see what’s on them. You finally hit the back of your bag and pull your arm out with a sheepish expression on your face. “Sorry Teach, it’s just that…my sister must have taken my homework” or “My dog ate my Chromebook.” Trust me, we’ve all been there before. 

This scenario, more specifically, is one that we refer to as the “I Lost It in My Backpack”. You know the drill—your backpack is a black hole. You reach in for your homework, and it’s like a scavenger hunt that could rival any reality show. You pull out everything from old snacks to that one sock you thought you lost last semester, but the homework? Nope, it’s gone. 

Then there's the infamous “I Thought It Was Due Tomorrow” excuse. This is a favourite among students everywhere. You know, you spend hours working on something, only to realize you mixed up the due dates. It’s like your brain has a built-in calendar that only works on weekends. Suddenly, the homework that you were so proud of is now a relic of the past, lost to the depths of your confusion.

Your parents are upset at you, your teachers are getting frustrated, heck even your dog’s angry for being the subject of all missing assignments, and all you can think about is that you do complete the homework, you just don’t know where it all goes. Or at least, you think you did it…wait did you? And that’s when it hits you. Your mind has fallen so deep into your delusions that you’ve started BELIEVING you DO your homework, and that something unfortunate ALWAYS seems to happen to it. 

As a fellow student, I can confirm that homework always sucks. I mean who wants to spend their afternoons doing assignments that don’t even get checked over half the time? But in the end, it is important to complete it, and in honour of the upcoming exam season, let’s start getting our homework turned in, because come on, who are you trying to trick? The teacher who’s been working with thousands of students for the past 10 years?

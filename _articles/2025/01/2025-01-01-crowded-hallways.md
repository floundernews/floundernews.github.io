TORONTO, ON —  The hallways at Mackenzie have turned into a battlefield, just like the Hunger Games. As the bell rings, students brace themselves for the ultimate challenge to get to class on time, unscathed. 

Students are both excited and tense for a little competition everyday to see who can get to class on time, unharmed. “What’s a hallway without a little friendly competition?” exclaimed Pushand Shuv. “Making it through these ruins means you can get anywhere in life” half-joked another.

Even the academic weapons are not immune. By measuring the dynamics and adding the equations together, they have created high-tech goggles that not only help them find the most optimal way through the crowd, but identify potential dangers and solutions.

However, not all technology can keep up. The Google Map app has struggled and crashed numerous times due to students overburdening the system, attempting to find the most efficient way to get to class on time. “My ETA changes every minute!” complained Dashen Thru, as traffic jams appear at stairwells. It seems that the apps are just as confused as everyone is, as what was supposed to be a simple walk to class has turned into a survival race against the next bell.

For those not as fortunate, the hallway competition is not pretty—from repeatedly getting elbowed and squished in the face to hurdling contestants and accidentally landing on them. Afraid of getting separated, some cling onto their friends’ backpack for dear life, in hopes of making it to class together. As the day goes on, simply transitioning from one class to another turns into a test of endurance, with many battle tales of survival. 

When all’s said and done, these hallways are not for the weak. Mackenzie’s hallways during passing periods is just one of the many amazing things the school has to offer. Surviving this place will prepare you for anything the world may throw at you, not just backpacks!

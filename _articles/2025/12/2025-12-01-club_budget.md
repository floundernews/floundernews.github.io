**MACKENZIE** \- In light of the astounding 500+ clubs in our school this year(which has put the approval process for said clubs into question), administrators have decided to allocate a minimal $10 to each club for spending purposes. 

Obviously, this is much to the dismay of presidents who believe that their clubs should receive more than others. Responsible leader of the Flounder fan club Anon Emaus, has shared their numerous complaints of this unfair distribution. “Our association requires much more than $10 to fund events for our 200+ members\! It’s ridiculous that we’re receiving the same as a certain mobile game club…” 

Of course, fundraising for clubs has become more difficult, as spots for occasional food days are limited. In order to assist clubs with funding, SAC has set up a “begging corner” in which representatives solemnly approach passersby for spare change. Though of course, this corner too has limited availability. 

A clever strategy (no comment on legality) to boost funds has been suggested by a student we interviewed, who wished to remain anonymous. President of the Lyon fan club and Matcha-Making club Tota LiBussted passionately says, “No one comes to the Lyon fan club anyway… therefore, I just move the funds towards my other club\! Haha, it’s genius… I’d get in trouble if SAC found out\!”. 

However, while $10 is certainly a pathetic sum of money, funding may not be necessary at all. A study conducted by the Flounder’s data analysts have concluded that on average, each club has 0.5 attendants per meeting (including execs). This statistic definitely makes sense, considering that the majority of the student body have their own clubs to run. 

So, maybe it’ll all work out in the end? I don’t know, I guess we’ll have to wait and see……

What’s more fun than doing every single ooey gooey mushy romantic event with your other half on the 14th of February? Going around and doing all that by yourself\!\!\! (Not sure if we’re following along…) Pshh couples are overrated anyway…right guys?... anyone? OKAY, so maybe not everyone wants to do a solo. However, there are many ways you could make Valentine’s Day special for someone as single as yourself, and to help you out, The Flounder has put together a list of activities to do when you’re tired of watching Love Island re-runs and third-wheeling your friend the 5th year in a row. Let’s jump right into it, shall we folks?

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER ONE\*\*

\*\*Go on a little self-care date.\*\*  
Who needs a partner to go out for food when you can go alone? There won’t be any debate about the 50/50 rule, and you won’t have to worry about going through that awkward “Should we get a dessert?” and then attempt to maintain self-control when you get the fudge brownie and your date takes more bites than you. I mean come ON read the room honey, I needed that dessert more than you did. Gosh… \<br\> \*Possible setback: You might need to tell the couple in the booth beside you to “get a room.”\*

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER TWO\*\*

\*\*Commit your evening to a movie marathon.\*\*  
The good ‘ol movie marathon comes into clutch every darn time. What’s better than sitting back with a cozy blanket and popcorn while streaming Netflix? The following movies include this year’s favourite romantic sitcoms list made by yours truly, the Flounder’s Staff team. The Exorcist (1973) \[a staff favourite\], Oppenheimer, and finally, with passion so great you could feel it through the screen, The Super Mario Bros. Movie. \<br\> \*Possible setback: You might spend the evening crying over sappy romances.\*

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER THREE\*\*

\*\*Take a “Why am I single” BuzzFeed quiz.\*\*  
Let us bathe in self-pity this year folks, cause it’s like sooo in. It’s 2025, get with the times\! \<br\> \*Possible setback: You might not like your results.\*

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER FOUR\*\*

\*\*Call your coupled friend and start a fight to ruin their day.\*\*  
Time to let go of all the betrayal and anger when they dumped you for some random dude. \<br\> \*Possible setback: Might destroy a 10-year friendship.\*

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER FIVE\*\*

\*\*Buy a bunch of Valentine themed chocolate boxes and splurge.\*\*   
It’s super obnoxious when you browse aisles at a store in February and all you see is heart this, pink that, love everything. Give it a break already. But then again, you’re only human, and resisting the delicious chocolates packed underneath that eye-roll wrapping is nearly impossible. \<br\> \*Possible setback: If your dad finds your chocolate first, there won’t be much left.\*

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER SIX\*\*

\*\*Search up “most depressing sad songs to sob to album” and stream it on Spotify.\*\*   
We recommend sitting under a hot shower or staring at the ceiling while lying on your back for this one. \<br\> \*Possible setback: You’re in the middle of a heartfelt crying session when an ad for Dental Hygiene pops up. Or your brother walks in and gives you a weird look. “OH MY GOSH LEAVE ME ALONE TO CRY FOR 10 MINUTES”\*

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER SEVEN\*\*

\*\*Walk around and leave a variety of anxiety-inducing sticky notes on people’s cars.\*\*  
Some ideas include “She’s pregnant” or “He’s cheating on you.” Once again, your one and only way to contribute to society this Valentine’s Day is by savagely destroying happiness and hope. Feel free to get creative with your notes — there are limitless possibilities to the ways in which you can give someone mild anxiety\!\<br\> \*Possible setback: Wait… we can’t find any haha.\*

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER EIGHT\*\*

\*\*Buy a bouquet of roses and obnoxiously chew on their petals in a public space\*\*  
Yorkdale Mall, a public library — you name it\! Be sure to chew with your mouth open and be as loud as humanly possible. NOM\! NOM\! NOM\! This will enable you to become a public menace, as you absolutely should be. \<br\> \*Possible setback: Hold up…can you even eat roses? Might want to fact-check that with your local flower vendor first. And try to ignore the weird look they might give you.\*

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER NINE\*\*

\*\*Take a walk and reflect on how happy you are to be single this year.\*\*  
Self-Care is something I’m carrying with me into 2025\. \<br\> \*Possible setback: You’re not voluntarily single.\*

\<span style="color:red"\> \*\*NUMBER TEN\*\*

\*\*Talk to your grandparents, parents, and/or the rest of your family so someone can claim that they love you.\*\*  
Everyone wants to know that they matter. That they are seen. That they are loved. Unfortunately, no one can provide you with that security except for the people who have no choice but to love you. Time to call them up and guilt them into saying those three magical words\! \<br\> \*Possible setback: Your family doesn’t like you.\*

As you can see, this list can create the 14th of February into a day that doesn’t have to be so dreaded anymore. The Flounder urges you to have fun this year, whether you’re doing these with a partner in crime or by yourself\! Have a Happy Valentine’s this year people. 

With Hesitant Fondness,

The Flounder

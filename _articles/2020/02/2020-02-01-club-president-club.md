Every fall, enterprising students vie to create new and exciting clubs to draw members and pad their resumes. But what about students who lack the creativity and drive to create their own club, but still need something to add to their university supplementary applications? This fall two Mackenzie students came up with a creative solution to this problem. They proposed a brand new and innovative way of running a club. A way that would shock the administration to the core and completely redefine the meaning of what a club at Mackenzie is meant to be.

The "Club President's Club" opened its doors to future executives in September and quickly grew to a whopping 45 executives and 0 members. The club valued inclusivity and equality above all else; anyone who attended a meeting would automatically become one of the club's many presidents. The club presidents would assemble once a week to plan meetings and discuss ways of increasing membership.

For a while things went well, or at least as well as possible for a club comprised entirely of bickering execs. The real trouble started when the club presidents were informed by the administration that a club could not, in fact, have more presidents than members and that the club would be shut down if half of the presidents did not step down to assume a lower rank.

For eleven days and twelve nights (incidentally setting a new Mackenzie record for longest time gone without sleep) the executive council deliberated on who would be allowed to keep their title. At the end of the megasecond, the directorate decided to put it to vote. Each president would vote for whomever they thought should keep their role. Somewhat unsurprisingly, it resulted in a forty-five way split.

Faced with no other options, the committee was forced to disband, but speculation as to what really happened is rampant. Some say that the club still exists, but meets in secret. Others claim that it has simply changed its name to escape detection, yet others insist that the club never existed in the first place.

The "Mackenzie Club President's Club Truther Club" (or MCPCTC) has recently taken to demanding the school for answers. As to what they did before the collapse of CPC is yet another mystery. Incidentally, MCPCTC has announced that they are still looking for forty-six people to fill empty roles as club vice-presidents.

William Lyon Mackenzie CI - All the reference sheets to be used for the mural in the foyer were mysteriously replaced by massive images of a flounder about a month and a half ago. Nobody had noticed the swap until just earlier this week, when several green paint cans were found collecting up with a peculiar amount of empty fluorescent turquoise paint cans.

A few hours after the incident, security camera footage of several Flounder staff members photocopying images of the fish had surfaced, but was disregarded and deemed merely a coincidence. Mackenzie’s head Security Camera Footage Analysis Specialist, Isar Klosed, would later explain, “We can’t go around judging people because they enjoy photocopying fish in their free time — that’s completely unreasonable.”

Staff and students alike were outraged after seeing the reference sheets and mural for themselves. “This is just unacceptable. The perpetrator of this heinous act should be punished to the fullest extent,” said an angry student. “The flounder on that paper doesn’t look realistic. The quality of the image is terrible, the proportions of the fins are wrong, the colour of the scales is completely off, and gills aren’t even supposed to look like that!”

In an effort to help out the painters of the mural, many students have submitted higher-quality images of flounders to be drawn.

TORONTO, ON - In the face of a new Omicron variant, students are turning off their cameras and microphones during virtual class to halt its new transmission methods.

“The new variant is the most infectious variant to date,” the head of a student announced in the chat last Monday at a Zoom meeting, “It has evolved to spread through sight as well as sound!” At an astonishing speed, students across TDSB have shut off their cameras and microphones citing Omicron transmission hazards. Impressed by their quick response, HOW applauded their efforts over Twitter, spreading these precautions even further across the globe.

Many teachers were misinformed due to the lack of email communications on the sudden change but luckily, nobody told them their cameras were off and their microphones were on mute. “It will be a rough semester but we need to tough it out for this pandemic to end.” comments Mike, winner of the science fair in response to the HOW tweet.

Unfortunately, there are numerous students actively voicing their opinion against the not yet enforced restrictions. While it is still legal, countless cameras with shoddy lighting and microphones with no noise suppression have endangered the lives of many. “How are we supposed to have a normal class if there’s no communication?” these students argue.

Zoom is anticipated to make a statement on whether they will be temporarily discontinuing those features through email next Wednesday. In the meantime, Google Meet has permanently discontinued its services saying, “We care about the next generation. We even innovated cameras out of our new Google Pixel 7! Buy it for the low, low price of $1899.99.” TDSB awaits the provincial government’s decision to go back in person, further preventing the spread of the new Omicron variant.

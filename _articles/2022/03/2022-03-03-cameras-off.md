TORONTO, ON - TDSB’s new policy mandates that any person online keep their cameras off to increase fair treatment amongst students who are visually impaired.

The new policy states that all cameras accessible by a meeting platform be covered by at least 5 rolls of duct tape while the meeting is active. Since the policy doesn’t state where to put the duct tape, it does not have to cover the camera.

If a student’s camera is turned on during class, they must click a red button at the bottom left of the screen. This will pause the meeting, turning the screen all black and disabling the camera.

All the students interviewed were strangely delighted with the policy change. One student says that constantly being on camera is stressful. “I always overthink myself, staring at other people,” they say. “Keeping the cameras off is just easier to manage! It helps me play Gensh- I mean it helps me pay more attention to class!”

Many teachers share a common enthusiasm for this new policy. “I’m proud to be spreading awareness for the visually impaired. They are a community that has been largely overlooked, and it’s good to put them in a fresh new perspective. Although, I wonder how the TDSB will apply this policy when students return to full in-person learning.”

Students are also proud to raise awareness for the visually impaired, seeing the disabled cameras as a badge of honour. “Supporting groups with disabilities is always beneficial. It’s good to know that the TDSB is willing to give them the attention they deserve. Knowing all the cameras are off must make visually impaired students feel welcomed.”

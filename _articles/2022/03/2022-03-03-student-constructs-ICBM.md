Toronto, ON - As students are once again thrown into virtual learning for absolutely no reason, one student, worried about his culminating assignment, has made the decision to deliver his project, a flimsy stick bridge, aboard an intercontinental ballistic missile in the most socially distanced way possible. 

George McMacmic, currently in Grade 11, had a very important culminating project for Physics where he had to build a bridge using only popsicle sticks. Upon discovering that the popsicle sticks were not for consumption, George was forced to purchase another bag with his beloved ape NFT. However, soon after constructing his bridge, he was told that the bridge was no longer a required part of the project. 

“I was absolutely enraged,” wrote George in his heavily downvoted “r/AITA” post, “it was like the school wanted to mess with me. Sure, I procrastinated and only glued a few sticks together at the time of the announcement, but hey, I had a sturdy and fully functional plank bridge. It is absolutely unacceptable to just trash my work like this.” 

“So after watching some YouTube videos related to rocketry and why the Earth is a doughnut-shaped object, I decided to try my hand at building my very own missile”, he continued, “for non-destructive uses, of course.”

After attempting and failing to build an object that could fly, George consulted his best friend Kum Jing On and purchased Kum’s Hwasong-17 MIRV-Capable Multi-Warhead Intercontinental Ballistic Nuclear Missile, minus the MIRV-capable, multi-warhead, and nuclear. “I decorated it a little bit to make it look like I built the missile myself. I mean, I’m just copying his homework.” 

The launch of this missile is planned for tomorrow, at 4:63 PM EST. 

At press time, George was arrested for terrorism.

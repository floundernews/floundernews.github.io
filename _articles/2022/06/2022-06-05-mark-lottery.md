TORONTO, ON - The TDSB recently elected to implement a new system of marking where each mark will be drawn through a lottery.

"There has been a lot of complaints about inequality in the school system and we plan to undermine it by giving marks at random," said Brian S. Ittee, the mastermind behind the revolutionary new scheme.

The administration states that this new change will give all students equal chances and let them focus on learning instead of marks. However, the student body at Mackenzie has voiced their opinions with a mixed reaction to this novel idea.

"I think it’s a fantastic idea," said an anonymous Grade 12 graduate. "Everyone keeps complaining about marks being necessary to get into a good university, but now that we have zero control over it, students can finally focus on what is important: learning."

While most of the grade twelves concur, a small minority of lower grades grade elevens and lower voiced concerns and disapproval with the new lottery system.

"While I think making marks completely random and in no way reflective of your abilities is quite practical, a lottery is just a boring way to do so; it's so old-fashioned," commented Bob, a Grade 9 student. Bob and other students are pushing to use random number generators instead. Many of them even sent their own programs to use in lieu of the lottery system.

At the time of writing, Flounder personnel found the current course median for the majority of courses to be 50%, a sharp plummet from before the change. Teachers who opted to use student programs for random number generation, however, saw a 17% increase in students’ averages.

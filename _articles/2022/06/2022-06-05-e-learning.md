COMPUTER DESK, ON — The recent introduction by the Ministry of Education of a new e-Learning graduation requirement has received an overwhelmingly positive response from the Mackenzie community. Despite the option to opt out, nearly all students are fully embracing the change to their high school experience.

“I must say, this novel channel of education is truly exquisite. The interactive features, simulations, and collaboration with my fellow citizens across this great province that e-Learning allows is simply extraordinary,” expressed Alexander II of House Lancre, a tenth-grade student at Mackenzie. “Also, my father hasn't spoken to me in years.”

“Nah, you already know big mans be pullin up with they transferable skills in digital literacy, no kizzy. All they other courses lookin straight mid fham, boutta get jumped for real, they already shakin,” explained Lil Macky, a ninth-grader and aspiring rapper who proceeded to promote his SoundCloud to our journalist team.

Our proud Lyons have also taken to social media to spread the love of e-Learning to peers all around the world.

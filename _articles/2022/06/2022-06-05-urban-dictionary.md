Toronto, ON - North York school William Lyon Mackenzie CI has adopted a new policy requiring all English classrooms to immediately switch over to using Urban Dictionary as the official English dictionary, replacing the Canadian Oxford dictionary.

The administration at the school was eager to explain this new strategy. “Look, the world is evolving and as a big school we have to adapt”, said Ben Dover, Kahoot Name Coordinator of WLMAC. “Using Urban Dictionary provides our students with a fresh way to look at the world around them. High school prepares students for the real world, and by teaching them this immensely expressive language, they will be well suited for the streets, you know, where they belong.”

“It’s the least we can do, and we always do the least.”

During a group fishing session in the bathroom, the Flounder has been able to witness this new policy in action. Mike Coxlong was preparing for his debate when he had a stroke of genius and replaced his concluding remarks with “L + ratio + skill issue + no maidens + objectively incorrect + cry about it + your’e\*”.

“You know, those last words really drove the point home and won the debate”, he remarked, “I meant, big W lmao rip bozo.”

Teachers, on the other hand, were on the fence about this new policy. Some were ecstatic that they could bring potentially offensive words into the classroom as a learning opportunity or artistic inspiration, while others were outright petrified.

“What the \*\*\*\* is a sussy baka??” remarked a teacher who wishes to remain anonymous.

TORONTO, ON - Upon returning to school on May 2nd, Mackenzie students were greeted with a cheery infestation of bunnies and colourful eggs.

Two weeks had passed since Easter Sunday when an undetected number of Easter bunnies and eggs were found in the unused lockers of students. “I thought the smell was just the lunch I left there 2 years ago.” said one student, who wishes to remain anonymous.

Understanding the severity of the situation, specialized exterminators were immediately called in to purge the festivities. By the afternoon, the school was evacuated as teams marched in bravely, equipped with flamethrowers for general use. Students watched in awe as Mackenzie pulled out all the stops against this late Easter infestation.

“We might be able to purge all the rabbits but there’s no way for us to get to the root of the problem ourselves,” one exterminator grimly commented, “We just have to hope the elite team can find all the eggs.” According to the animal breeding department, undetected breeding by Easter bunnies left unchecked for two weeks leads to insurmountable population numbers. Estimates land the number anywhere from 50,000 to 130,000. Some students were found to be adopting the bunnies they picked up on the way out of the building but they were quickly confiscated and killed.

After many of the bunnies had been burned, the elite team arrived to cut off the source of the bunnies: the elusive easter eggs. The remaining fires were promptly put out to ensure the safety of the team. All along the walls, melted chocolate oozed to the floor proving to be a distraction hazard. Still, the local daycare kids were let loose inside the building under the premise of an easter egg hunt and in under an impressive hour, they had all been found. Congratulations to Bobby for taking home the gold medal for this hunt.

Thanks to the swift action of the school in tandem with the extermination team, the Easter infestation was quickly dealt with. An email communication was later sent to all parents and students promising that this affair will never happen again. Unfortunately, as if asking for another outbreak, the animal breeding department secretly kept a few Easter eggs citing their reason as “studying purposes.”

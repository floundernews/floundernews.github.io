TORONTO, ON - In response to student complaints, the T.D.S.B. has introduced a new policy that allows tests and quizzes to be graded by the students themselves.

Students felt they should be trusted to mark their own tests and quizzes and that teachers have too much power. “It feels wrong that my teacher knows so much about me," said one Grade 11 student.  "Even my own parents know less."

It took only a few weeks of complaining for the new system to be given the go-ahead. Students are rejoicing and say that their next self-graded test will receive a "completion mark."

“I don’t remember the last time I was so happy with my mark!” announced one excited Grade 12 student.

“I’m proud of my latest test,” remarked another student. “I got a perfect score without having to argue with my teacher!  And without even having had to study!"”

Some teachers have fully embraced the policy change.  "My class is getting exceptional grades!" bragged Ms. Slacker.  Other teachers say that they have mixed feelings.  "I will miss using my red pen," says Mr. Maroon.

“The new policy promises to be a popular change,” says E. Z. Pass, the student ambassador of T.D.S.B.'s Centre for Healthy and Equitable Assessments of Tasks (CHEAT). "I have no doubt that we will see real boosts in student achievement, and that is what we should all care about."

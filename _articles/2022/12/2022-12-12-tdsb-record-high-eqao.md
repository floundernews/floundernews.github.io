TORONTO ON - The TDSB is hosting a school board-wide celebration this Friday over a record-high 52% pass rate on the EQAO amongst all Grade 9 students. The pass rate skyrocketed following a wave of school motto changing sparked by William Lyon Mackenzie C.I.

After the official change of motto from “Sua Praemia Laudi” to “Deb ababaab cbdbc” in 2019 received unanimous praise from the Grade 9 population of Mackenzie, many other schools followed suit in an attempt to provide their Grade 9 students with a boost, morale and score-wise, as well. By the next EQAO season, 93% of TDSB schools adopted the new motto. It did not change the following year.

It appears that students truly “took the message to heart,” as the Mackenzie administration had advised. The overall pass rate on the recent EQAO nearly doubled to 52% compared to pre-motto change rates, with the largest increases witnessed in the schools that implemented the motto change.

“I am so grateful to the school for leading this motto change revolution,” says Billy Venn, praising the change. “52 is like, the highest number I know. Where do we even go now? 51?” He says he answered the test questions with ease and is certain that he “got at least the first 15 questions.”

Many Grade 9 students are expressing similar overwhelming confidence in their answers to the first 15 questions, though the same was not necessarily said for the other questions.

Early critics of the motto change—they were concerned that the new motto involved subliminal brainwashing—are now championing the new motto given the results of the EQAO exam.

Some Mackenzie students are pushing to change the entire school crest and believe that doing so might push pass rates to 100%. The proposed new school crest does away with the lion and sunset and would be a sequence of 50 letters.

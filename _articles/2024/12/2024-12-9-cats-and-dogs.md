“The news really hit me hard. I mean, Toronto is only 3 hours away from the border. If all the cats are being eaten in the US, it’s not too long before Canada follows.” - Ms *Trahnzgendrohp Rations*, local cat citizen

“This really is a tragic time for felines and canines alike. I think it is important to lessen the divide and bring our two sides together, in order to properly fight this issue. Unfortunately, the big cats and dogs are constantly encouraging the divide between our two sides.” - *Mr Ohn AyeLeglle*, full time dog, national award winning fetch champion

“I really do feel for all of our American counterparts. I mean what they are going through must be horrible. Thoughts and prayers.” - *Mr AyLiens*, friendly neighborhood cat

“Look, I’ve always been skeptical of humans, especially when they keep pointing lasers at walls for no reason, but this… this is something else entirely.” - *Ms. Inprizinze*, Toronto cat representative of International Cats Council

CANADA -- A new student-led group, the Recruitment of Instructors and Office-staff Team (RIOT), has been appointed by the WLMAC administration to manage the hiring process. These students will be in charge of accepting or rejecting applicants for the positions of teachers, office staff, principal, and various minor administrative positions, in addition to being responsible for the continued employment of current staff.

“We wanted to give students an opportunity to advocate for themselves and learn valuable leadership skills,” remarked a spokesman for the school. “One day, they will be in charge of hiring staff for small businesses or fast-food franchises. It’s important they understand early the power they hold and the impact their decisions have on people’s lives.”

RIOT currently consists of ten members, mostly in grades 11 and 12, including two junior positions. While most are general members, there is a chair in charge of running meetings, and Justin Lu has stepped up as the resident photographer and videographer.

They will meet twice a month to review pending applications. According to RIOT’s published rulebook, the Universal Protocol for the Recruitment and Induction of Staff in Institutions Necessitating Good-will, after reading aloud the application, members hold a vote on whether or not to hire them.

“We don’t believe in the interview process. We know how stressful it can be, and in our experience, it rarely provides meaningful insight into a person’s capabilities on the job. Instead, we put all the questions normally asked in an interview into a Google Form, and we have all applicants fill it out,” explained the chair.

Another member added, “During the culminating season, we usually have a lot going on. We want to focus on our mental health, so we make sure to reduce the stress placed on us by randomly discarding half of all applications made around that time.”

Parents and a few members of staff have lauded criticisms against the group, fearing that students may “overstep” or “abuse their nigh-infinite power over the very staff responsible for their education and development.” However, since its implementation, student averages have been steadily increasing, with no signs of stopping soon. Currently, the school is experiencing a 145% average, the highest in the country.

“These fears are completely unfounded. I am certain that our lawyers have put ample consideration into ensuring that there are always checks in place to prevent students from being able to act outside of the restrictions placed by staff and unilaterally remove current staff from their positions,” spoke former RIOT staff supervisor Ms Taek.

The staff at the school who have remained long enough to comment seem very hopeful for the current generation’s prospects after this display of integrity and decision-making skills. RIOT is currently looking into Board policies to see how they may go about hiring youth administration as part of their Principles Through Principals program.

title: New Student Council President Makes Mackenzie Great Again
---

After extensive scientific research from the school's yoga department, lead yogi Reggie ÜnÜnÜn discovered that a [new strain of Covid-19](https://tenor.com/view/coronavirus-covid19-trump-pandemic-virus-gif-16778703) had accidentally βeen faxed to all memβers of the current student council, thus requiring a premature inauguration of the 2021-2022 student council in the midst of quadmester 4.

Of all the new memβers in office, the student council president, βarsh βharma, has had the greatest impact. Firstly, many disapprove of his election process. βarsh βharma actually placed last in the presidential vote; however all other candidates had accidentally βeen faxed a mountain, thus defaulting βarsh βharma as president.

βeyond his controversial election, βarsh βharma's campaign promises have also βeen the suβject of heated deβate. New air conditioning and monthly P.A. days were promised. βarsh βharma first βegan βy installing [a state of the art industrial fan](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11123989744890462450?lsf=seller:138301872,store:18046511425459778200,s:h&prds=oid:8244936366067232085&hl=en&ei=HLKUYJmXN8e3tQamwL3ABQ) in every classroom. As for the P.A. days, the Canadian Government had accidentally βeen faxed a new legislation that voided the Gregorian calendar in favour of a new βharmanian calendar, which had an 8th day of the week known as βarshday. βarsh βharma took advantage of this fortuitous accident βy making one βarshday a month a P.A. day.

Finally, there's the issue of βarsh βharma's new policies. He declared that any occurrence of the letter "β" in text must βe capitalized in Loβster font. Any student who disoβeys will fail english. Additionally, any staff who disoβey will also fail english. Furthermore, all cluβ βudgets have βeen cut down 99% to cover the 9001% increase in school fax machine use. It is unknown why fax rates have recently skyrocketed, βut βarsh βharma βlames gloβal warming.

While βarsh βharma's presidency has had mixed reception (some hate it while others really hate it), no one has βeen aβle to prevent these changes as no denizen of Mackenzie is 100% sure what the student council president actually can/cannot do. However, according to [a trusted source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia), βarsh βharma's approval ratings have recently skyrocketed ever since he created his wikipedia account, so there's no douβt that the school is ultimately in capaβle hands.

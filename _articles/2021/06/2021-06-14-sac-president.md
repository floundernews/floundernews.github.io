title: New Student Council President Makes Mackenzie Great Again
---

After extensive scientific research from the school's yoga department, lead yogi Reggie ÜnÜnÜn discovered that a [new strain of Covid-19](https://tenor.com/view/coronavirus-covid19-trump-pandemic-virus-gif-16778703) had accidentally <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>een faxed to all mem<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>ers of the current student council, thus requiring a premature inauguration of the 2021-2022 student council in the midst of quadmester 4.

Of all the new mem<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>ers in office, the student council president, <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma, has had the greatest impact. Firstly, many disapprove of his election process. <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma actually placed last in the presidential vote; however all other candidates had accidentally <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>een faxed a mountain, thus defaulting <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma as president.

<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>eyond his controversial election, <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma's campaign promises have also <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>een the su<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>ject of heated de<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>ate. New air conditioning and monthly P.A. days were promised. <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma first <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>egan <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>y installing [a state of the art industrial fan](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11123989744890462450?lsf=seller:138301872,store:18046511425459778200,s:h&prds=oid:8244936366067232085&hl=en&ei=HLKUYJmXN8e3tQamwL3ABQ) in every classroom. As for the P.A. days, the Canadian Government had accidentally <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>een faxed a new legislation that voided the Gregorian calendar in favour of a new <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harmanian calendar, which had an 8th day of the week known as <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arshday. <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma took advantage of this fortuitous accident <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>y making one <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arshday a month a P.A. day.

Finally, there's the issue of <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma's new policies. He declared that any occurrence of the letter "<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>" in text must <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>e capitalized in Lo<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>ster font. Any student who diso<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>eys will fail english. Additionally, any staff who diso<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>ey will also fail english. Furthermore, all clu<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b> <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>udgets have <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>een cut down 99% to cover the 9001% increase in school fax machine use. It is unknown why fax rates have recently skyrocketed, <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>ut <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>lames glo<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>al warming.

While <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma's presidency has had mixed reception (some hate it while others really hate it), no one has <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>een a<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>le to prevent these changes as no denizen of Mackenzie is 100% sure what the student council president actually can/cannot do. However, according to [a trusted source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia), <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>arsh <b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>harma's approval ratings have recently skyrocketed ever since he created his wikipedia account, so there's no dou<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>t that the school is ultimately in capa<b style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">B</b>le hands.

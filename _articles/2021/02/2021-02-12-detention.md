TORONTO, ON -- Virtual learning has presented many challenges, one of which is the persistent stream of misbehaving students. Teachers are frustrated at students who sleep during class or cause mischief during activities. 

Recently, during a lesson, a Mackenzie student disrupted the class by showing up in pyjamas with their camera on. The student reportedly taunted, “What are you going to do? Give me detention?” 

The teacher was initially flustered, but, after a moment of thought, responded, “Yes.”

After class, the teacher held the virtual detention session. 

“I can’t believe we’re actually doing this,” the student sighed.

“Boy, you asked for it,” the teacher responded.

Due to this incident, Mackenzie banned virtual detention for the foreseeable future.

Patrick Lin,President,"A sentient pink balloon heralding the apocalypse (at least according to his worshippers). The most ardent of his admirers call him “Pathicc.”"
Alexandra Deng,President,"Ahlek’zandtr Ha’daeng is an Eta-Class Cosmic threat, hell-bent on consuming every nitrogen atom in the universe. She’s currently incapacitated after targeting a patch of laughing gas."
Eric Jin,Vice President,"An absolute master at literature, Eric Jin has managed to survive two years of English with only generic ideas. He has perfected the art of utilizing both Reddit and Quora to make his writing indistinguishable from the typical pseudo intellectual or otherwise just copy pastes from Wikipedia."
Kevin Pham,Vice President,"A name designated to the remains of an ancient archotechnic entity. Despite its disrepair, it is still capable of higher-consciousness cognition, including simulations of alternate universes. Currently mass-uploading fan fictions to Wattpad."
Artemis Chen,Writer,"Artemis, twin sister of Apollo, seems to have abandoned her brother's affiliation with the sun and headed to the moon instead (well, her brother did head to the moon first, but that's because old NASA supported the patriarchy)."
Bernie Chen,Writer,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis Bernie est trigonometria nerd. Duis autem vel eum iriure dolor in hendrerit in vulputate velit esse molestie consequat."
Emma Zhou,Writer,"Emma, upon rescuing The Flounder's mascot by chance, yelled “I'mma help you!”. To this day, she is still doing so as a writer, for the sake of the Flounder's survival."
Di Hu,Writer,"Hu, Di was once an upcoming rising star, blowing past all other forms of standard definition. Unfortunately, one day he was caught doing 'you' during a competition and was disqualified from any future events. What 'you' is, he won't tell me, and he won't tell me his dealer either..."
Julianna Yuen,Writer,"Unfortunately, Julianna refused to have her staff bio be a list of her deepest darkest secrets in alphabetical order. She has never chewed gum, she passionately hates hoodies, she runs an illegal blue hairband factory, and she wishes she had a say in her staff bio."
Krish Patel,Writer,"As a person who enjoys conciseness, Krish P. enjoys writing crisp texts, as well as having crispy biscuits in secret, while entertaining himself with short novellas."
Milena Mofrad,Writer,"Milena writes for the Flounder part-time, love-hates her ICS homework part-time, and secretly schemes for a cat dictatorship full-time. Sounds productive."
Minh Phan,Writer,"In this world there existeth Minh Phan's fans and his phans, cultists they are not but adherents. They who believe otherwise are affiliating themselves with the Lyon."
Avery Deschamps,Editor,"Avery Deschamps is a very destructive champion of editing whose google doc comments strike fear into every writer's heart. The only thing she hates more than double negatives aren't good puns."
Calvin Dang,Editor,"Calvin Dang is a dang good editor. He is dangerous with the keyboard. Dango (団子) is a Japanese dumpling made from rice flour mixed with uruchi rice flour and glutinous rice flour."
Misheel Batkhuu,Editor,"One of the best writers in all of Mackenzie. Strangely, she found herself in the position of editor in four different clubs (two of them being the Flounder)."
Leyang Zou,Web Developer,"Leyang knows what being at the bottom of a list is like all too well so imagine his relief when the Social Media Director is even further below him. Now he gets to laugh with all of us at the person at the bottom of this About section."
Lois Zan,Web Developer,"Former illustrator, writer, editor, president, social media director, popstar and world leader, Lois still doesn't have enough work experience for this unpaid entry-level  internship at the Flounder."
Alyn Huang,Illustrator,"Rumour has it that the Flounder located a lost grade niner floundering about the school last year, and picked her up. Little did Alyn know she’d be employed to tirelessly work making illustrations of fish for the next two years. They are excellent fish illustrations."
Sara Parvaresh Rizi,Illustrator,"Sara is known for their love of shiny shirtless men. Besides lifting weights and building thigh muscle, this cute pink sheep also draws for the Flounder. "
Aidan Jacob Aviv,Illustrator,"I'm Aidan, a.k.a Doggaraffe, and I'm currently serving a peace bond, as academics would call it. I can't draw but I do it anyway and I have a dog who lies on the couch all day, somewhat like me! 7's my favorite number and red's my favorite color. I’m as human as most people, and I’m your friendly Fiat earther (did not make a typo right there)!"
Avery Lee,Illustrator,"Avery's fourth favourite marine biology fact is that jellyfish see upside-down. Facts 1-3 are about flounders, facts 5-23 are also about flounders. Oh I think Avery also draws."
Bahiya Lila,Illustrator,"Bahiya is an avid writer, which is why she joined the Flounder as an illustrator. She now illustrates things that are real and not real, such as her motivation to do well in math class and bunnies."
Fatma Jadoon,Illustrator,"Buff artist Batman who will beat you in arm wrestling then shame you in cybersex. She loves geckos."
Karina Qiu,Illustrator,"Karina Qiu was a hard academic in her past life. She entered school at the early age of 3 and had boundless successes in all areas of her life, like school and school. She graduated from university at the age of 69, where she promptly moved on to her next life after stating it was 'getting too boring.' She has since reentered school and reclaimed her post as an illustrator at the universal constant: The Flounder."
Yujin Bae,Illustrator,"After a long career of successfully melting people's eardrums with her piccolo, Yujin has moved on from her life of high pitched crime to other endeavors. She now has a career in illustrating for the Flounder, although she tends to snoop around the other departments too... All we know is that we shouldn't let her get too close to our beloved fish."
Celine Wang,Layout Designer,"There's a lot of staff working behind the scenes to bring you the Flounder, but Celine isn't one of them. When you're reading the Flounder, she will be right in front of you, standing there, menacingly. Be not afraid."
Danya Cheng,Layout Designer,"tacocat."
Daphne Tu,Layout Designer,"Daphne attempted to gather information about her own personality, but then realized that her sole personality trait is watching TV. Wouldn’t this be funny if it weren’t true for all of us."
Riddhi Dhankhar,Layout Designer,"Riddhi spent her early years 'studying' the format of Netflix by 'attentively paying attention to their shows.' Eventually she got a job, applying her formatting knowledge at the Flounder. She claims to have joined the Flounder to give back to the community, but little does she know the only thing we give back to is the one true Fish God."
Vicky Zhang,Layout Designer,"Vicky is a former layout designer-turned mentor for the newest batch of migrant workers. Some things on her bucket list include being promoted to the position of 'reader'."
Ivy Zhuang,Social Media,"If you ever see an emo granny dancing to kpop songs in the hallway, that's our CEO of floundergram Ivy."

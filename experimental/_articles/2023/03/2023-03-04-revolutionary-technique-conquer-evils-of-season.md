TORONTO, ON - The Mackenzie Organisation of Reviving Optimism and Necessary Support spent the month of January melting snow and painting trees green in a valiant effort to end seasonal depression.

As Mackenzie dove deeper into the winter season, seasonal depression rates continued to rise. However, students were not worried, since they knew they could rely on their Council of Mental Wellness to help them out. After three days of endless meetings, debates, and swordfights, the council finally proposed a solution.

“Seasonal Depression without ‘winter’ is ‘Sasoal Dpsso’, which is not a thing,” says Timmy Smith, grand overlord of the council. “Our plan is foolproof: no snow, no winter, no seasonal depression!”

The council called on all students for help - seeking donations of toasters, ovens, or hairdryers, to melt the snow. The Mackenzie community responded with great enthusiasm collecting over 1000 appliances.

The council also accepted donations of metal to build a small green paint factory. However, they were denied the building rights to do this as it was deemed “dangerous,” “illegal,” and “totally ridiculous.”

Despite the setbacks , the council made great progress in their mission, melting 90% of snow on Mackenzie territory, and painting 13 trees.

The snowless fields and painted trees have proven to be effective. Seasonal depression rates have decreased by 100%, and 98% of the Mackenzie community are happy with the council’s solution. Students had plenty of positive, insightful things to say. Jimmy Smith, an 11th - Grade student, stated, “You know, before I was sad. Now, I am not sad.”

Nonetheless, some people in the Mackenzie community are unhappy with this change. These people are the Treehuggers. 

“The paint on the trees is not drying! How are we supposed to hug them?”

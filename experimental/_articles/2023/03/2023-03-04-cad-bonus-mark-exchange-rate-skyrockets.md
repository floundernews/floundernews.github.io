TORONTO, ON — In these trying times of economic recession, Canadians have found one bright spot in the otherwise gloomy picture: the exchange rate between Canadian dollars (CAD) and bonus marks (BM) has blown up.

For those unfamiliar with bonus marks, they are a form of currency typically given out by teachers as a reward for an exceedingly merit-worthy performance. Criticized for being an exclusive prize for only the most skilled Kahoot winners, the value of bonus marks are now being brought into the spotlight. And in this recession, they have become more valuable than ever.

According to economists, the reason for this spike in the CAD to BM exchange rate is simple: students are increasingly willing to do just about anything to earn a bonus mark or two. As recent times perpetuate a difficult economy, the value of the Canadian dollar has plummeted and extra credit has become terribly expensive. Some are even using CAD cash as toilet paper over the school's sandpaper. If this seems complicated, you are not alone. Nobody really understands how this situation got to its current point, and many are furious. 

But those shrewd enough to have hoarded past bonus marks, life is good. The selling price of bonus marks is at an all time high, enabling hoarders to afford luxuries that were once out of reach, like diets beyond ramen noodles and tap water alone.

"I used to have to choose between buying the same ice coffee or trying a seasonal special," said one lucky bonus mark holder. "But now, thanks to the high exchange rate, I can afford both!!"

Of course, not everyone is thrilled with this turn of events. Many are calling for government intervention to stabilize the CAD to BM exchange rate, arguing that it is creating a two-tier economy where only the lucky few thriving on bonus marks can afford to live comfortably.
For now though, Canadians will have to make do. As for those without bonus marks, there is always hope that the next recession will bring even more favorable exchange rates.

The CAD to BM exchange rate has broken records in these financially hard times and other than the teacher’s pets with a steady stream of Bonus Marks rolling in, many students are still struggling to make ends meet.

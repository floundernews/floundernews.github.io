TORONTO, ON — Mr. Cheaper’s Grade 11 Social Responsibilities class was treated to quite the feast last Friday - and they *certainly* earned it.

The generous bunch of teens donated a whopping *six* food items to this year’s school food drive, far more than their competing classes. As a reward for donating the most food to charity, they were treated to a gourmet buffet lunch, provided by the school.

Mrs.Giving, the school lead for the food drive project stated, “We’re so proud of all the students who donated food for the greater good, and especially Mr. Cheaper’s class for showing a clear, collective commitment to helping others in need.”

All collected food items were donated to a local soup kitchen. 

When asked about what they’ve learned from this food drive experience, a student from Mr.Cheaper’s class said, “Donating food is awesome because the reward is *amazing*! It just goes to show that if you give to others, you’ll eventually be rewarded yourself.”

Another student commented, “I love giving to others, because you get so much more than you gave in return! The meal was delicious and I was completely stuffed at the end - that buffet lunch could have fed *so* many people!”

Mr. Cheaper’s students definitely enjoyed their tasty victory for this food drive, and now eagerly await the upcoming clothing drive. One student expressed their excitement, “I can’t wait to donate an old shirt or something - for the reward of an entire new wardrobe from The Gap!”

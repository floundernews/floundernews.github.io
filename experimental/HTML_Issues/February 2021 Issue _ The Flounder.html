Now they only seem to grow poppies."</div> <div class="author">By: El Chapo</div> <br> <p>TORONTO, ON – Today, the Toronto Police Service have wrapped up one of their most extensive investigations this month, and the entire Mackenzie Gardening Club has been detained on charges of drug production.</p> <p>Throughout the year, Gardening Club members had been illegally using the school gardening plot to grow an assortment of narcotic plants. The plants were then refined into potent substances using the school’s chemistry equipment. “Someone’s been watching too much Breaking Bad,” Police detective Anaisha Agarwal commented in a press briefing.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the reaction to the incident has been mixed from the student body. “They used to grow all kinds of flowers. Now they only seem to grow poppies” a grade 11 student named Muhammed Ali noted disappointedly. “I miss the orchids. I like orchids.”</p> <p>On the other hand, some students will be missing the revenue. “If the government will not pay for the school’s air conditioning, who will? Our only option is to take the fate of our air conditioning into our own hands, and pay for it ourselves” a grade 12 student named Quinton D’Souza wrote in an angry email to the school’s principal. “The fastest way to raise the required funds is through the narcotics trade, whether it’s frowned upon or not.”</p> <p>Despite the mixed response from students, Mackenzie’s administration has fully condemned the actions of the Gardening Club. “I am deeply disappointed in this club,” Mackenzie’s Assistant Vice-Principal Timmy Rice told the Flounder. “As with smoking and vaping, it is TDSB policy that all drug production be done off school property.”</p> </div> <hr> <div id="valentines-day" class="article-wrapper"> <h2>Valentine's Day <a class="external-link"

Early results yielded incredible success rates, with all students pleading innocent on the upcoming evaluation.

The administration emailed all William Lyon Mackenzie students, ordering that webcams be kept on through their virtual classes. Completely coincidentally, at least so we are told, webcams have been breaking left and right, and almost every single student’s webcam has broken. Now, we should not have to tell you that this is one of the most suspicious moves we’ve seen by administration since the taco crisis of ‘92. As the only good news source of Mackenzie, it was our duty to investigate.</p> <p><strong>Fact:</strong> January 18th - Administration sent emails asking for webcams to be active</p> <p><strong>Fact:</strong> January 19th - 99% of webcams stop working</p> <p>First, to more clearly visualize the evidence, we ran a supercomputer simulation of the data, and the results are below so that the public can understand the situation at hand.</p> <figure> <img src="./February 2021 Issue _ The Flounder_files/2021-02-12-webcam-broken.png"> </figure> <p>The data proves that this situation is too damning to be a coincidence. We believe a massive conspiracy is going on right in front of our very eyes.</p> <p>We knew that BIG TECH had to be involved, so we asked the key question: What do they have to gain from remotely hacking and destroying almost every webcam in the school? Was it money, power, both, or neither? This is something that we had to figure out.</p> <p>We went undercover, from factories to product design to shipping. We saw it all. However, everything seemed surprisingly, even suspiciously, normal. In addition, all of the tested webcams worked perfectly fine, so we knew they had a mole in The Flounder.</p> <p>We also discovered that almost every single teacher’s webcam worked. After countless hours of investigating, we could finally reach a conclusion to the investigation. We believe that this is a massive school-wide deep state prank on students. And this is not the first time that teachers have pranked students by telling them to do the impossible. For example, back in 2020, students were forced to use Bongo. We all know the devastating consequences of that. Believe it or not, this is the truth. While it may be ghastly, it is up to us at The Flounder to provide you with accurate information when all other school newspapers shy away.</p> </div> <hr> <div id="valentines-day-expectations" class="article-wrapper"> <h2>Valentine's Day Expectations VS Reality <a class="external-link" href="https://flounder.news/2021/02/valentines-day-expectations/"> <svg height="1em" width="1em" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 1000 1000" enable-background="new 0 0 1000 1000" xml:space="preserve"> <metadata> Svg Vector Icons : http://www.onlinewebfonts.com/icon </metadata> <g fill="currentColor"><g transform="translate(0.000000,511.000000) scale(0.100000,-0.100000)"><path d="M2921.9,4981.1c-216.4-57.4-408.5-220.8-499.1-424c-35.3-75.1-42-185.5-50.8-947.4l-11-861.3l-861.3-11c-819.3-11-865.7-13.3-960.6-57.4c-159-75.1-278.3-194.3-357.8-357.7l-72.9-148l-6.6-3146.9c-4.4-3142.5-4.4-3146.9,42-3299.3c39.7-132.5,66.3-172.2,183.3-291.5c119.2-117.1,159-143.5,291.5-183.3c152.4-46.4,156.8-46.4,3299.3-41.9l3146.9,6.6l148,72.9c163.4,79.5,282.7,198.8,357.8,357.8c44.2,95,46.4,141.3,57.4,960.6l11,861.3l861.3,11c819.3,11,865.7,13.3,960.6,57.4c159,75.1,278.3,194.3,357.8,357.7l72.9,148l6.6,3146.9c4.4,3142.5,4.4,3146.9-41.9,3299.3c-39.8,132.5-66.3,172.3-183.3,291.5c-117,114.8-161.2,143.5-287.1,183.3c-150.2,46.4-161.2,46.4-3257.3,44.2C3741.2,5009.8,2999.2,5003.2,2921.9,4981.1z M9151.7,1246.8v-3014.4H6137.3H3122.9v3014.4v3014.4h3014.4h3014.4V1246.8z M2372,16.7v-1972.1l64-132.5c75.1-156.8,192.1-280.5,344.5-360l110.4-59.6l1992-6.6l1994.2-4.4v-761.9v-761.9H3862.7H848.3v3014.4v3014.4h761.9H2372V16.7z"></path><path d="M5629.4,3477.2c-300.3-108.2-333.5-519-55.2-682.4c72.9-44.2,117-46.4,792.8-53l715.5-6.6L5887.8,1538.3C5064,712.3,4682,314.8,4657.7,259.6c-46.4-114.8-42-216.4,17.7-326.8c90.5-170,291.5-240.7,474.8-165.6c55.2,24.3,452.7,406.3,1278.7,1230.1l1196.9,1194.7l6.6-715.5c6.6-675.8,8.8-719.9,53-792.8c53-92.8,163.4-170,267.2-189.9c176.7-33.1,377.6,97.2,426.2,273.8c15.5,66.3,22.1,448.3,17.7,1280.9l-6.6,1185.9l-50.8,81.7c-28.7,44.2-88.3,103.8-132.5,132.5l-81.7,50.8l-1203.6,4.4C5923.1,3508.1,5702.2,3503.7,5629.4,3477.2z"></path></g></g> </svg> </a> </h2> <br> <figure> <img src="./February 2021 Issue _ The Flounder_files/2021-02-12-valentines-day-expectations.png"> </figure> </div> <hr> <div id="social-distancing-gum-injuries" class="article-wrapper"> <h2>Mackenzie Social Distancing Policies Put in Place Due to Gum-Related Injuries <a class="external-link" href="https://flounder.news/2021/02/social-distancing-gum-injuries/"> <svg height="1em" width="1em" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 1000 1000" enable-background="new 0 0 1000 1000" xml:space="preserve"> <metadata> Svg Vector Icons : http://www.onlinewebfonts.com/icon </metadata> <g fill="currentColor"><g transform="translate(0.000000,511.000000) scale(0.100000,-0.100000)"><path d="M2921.9,4981.1c-216.4-57.4-408.5-220.8-499.1-424c-35.3-75.1-42-185.5-50.8-947.4l-11-861.3l-861.3-11c-819.3-11-865.7-13.3-960.6-57.4c-159-75.1-278.3-194.3-357.8-357.7l-72.9-148l-6.6-3146.9c-4.4-3142.5-4.4-3146.9,42-3299.3c39.7-132.5,66.3-172.2,183.3-291.5c119.2-117.1,159-143.5,291.5-183.3c152.4-46.4,156.8-46.4,3299.3-41.9l3146.9,6.6l148,72.9c163.4,79.5,282.7,198.8,357.8,357.8c44.2,95,46.4,141.3,57.4,960.6l11,861.3l861.3,11c819.3,11,865.7,13.3,960.6,57.4c159,75.1,278.3,194.3,357.8,357.7l72.9,148l6.6,3146.9c4.4,3142.5,4.4,3146.9-41.9,3299.3c-39.8,132.5-66.3,172.3-183.3,291.5c-117,114.8-161.2,143.5-287.1,183.3c-150.2,46.4-161.2,46.4-3257.3,44.2C3741.2,5009.8,2999.2,5003.2,2921.9,4981.1z M9151.7,1246.8v-3014.4H6137.3H3122.9v3014.4v3014.4h3014.4h3014.4V1246.8z M2372,16.7v-1972.1l64-132.5c75.1-156.8,192.1-280.5,344.5-360l110.4-59.6l1992-6.6l1994.2-4.4v-761.9v-761.9H3862.7H848.3v3014.4v3014.4h761.9H2372V16.7z"></path><path d="M5629.4,3477.2c-300.3-108.2-333.5-519-55.2-682.4c72.9-44.2,117-46.4,792.8-53l715.5-6.6L5887.8,1538.3C5064,712.3,4682,314.8,4657.7,259.6c-46.4-114.8-42-216.4,17.7-326.8c90.5-170,291.5-240.7,474.8-165.6c55.2,24.3,452.7,406.3,1278.7,1230.1l1196.9,1194.7l6.6-715.5c6.6-675.8,8.8-719.9,53-792.8c53-92.8,163.4-170,267.2-189.9c176.7-33.1,377.6,97.2,426.2,273.8c15.5,66.3,22.1,448.3,17.7,1280.9l-6.6,1185.9l-50.8,81.7c-28.7,44.2-88.3,103.8-132.5,132.5l-81.7,50.8l-1203.6,4.4C5923.1,3508.1,5702.2,3503.7,5629.4,3477.2z"></path></g></g> </svg> </a> </h2> <div class="description">"I now know how it feels to chew 5 gum… painful," says Yom Ama, a bubblegum abuse victim.</div> <div class="author">By: Dick Kickem</div> <br> <p>The 2020-2021 school year at Mackenzie requires staff and students to follow new social distancing policies to avoid cohesive chewable confectionary catastrophes, more commonly known as bubble trouble. Many students have found this adjustment difficult, however given the circumstances, it was a necessary policy to implement.</p> <p>March 2020 marked the lockdown of schools after several bubblegum-related issues posed a risk to all denizens of Mackenzie. Shortly before this lockdown, students at Mackenzie had begun an illegal bubblegum black market, which soon escalated into a far greater issue. Long gone were the days of secretly smoking toilet rolls or eating drugs, for a new, much more dangerous form of addiction had been born.</p> <p>Bubblegum from the gum brand Blow™ was modified by local drug kingpin James Simpson in order to increase bubble diameter. This new variant, known as Blow™: J. Simpson, did indeed increase bubble diameter by roughly 500%, however, there were many unforeseen side effects. Firstly, the rat poison used to strengthen the bubble seeps down the throat after chewing, causing irreparable damage to the body. A symptom of this is heavy coughing, hence the current stigma around coughing in public. Other than the health risks posed to the individual chewer, the bubbles have disastrous consequences when popped. According to quantum bubble-blowing physics and high-density flimflam theory, the bubbles are far too densely packed–leagues beyond bubble-blowing regulation. As a result, anyone within the vicinity of a pop experiences a blast comparable to several nuclear warheads.</p> <p>In response to this issue, Mackenzie formed the Collective Regime Aimed at Pop-prevention (CRAP). After much deliberation with TDSB administrators, they created the current social distancing. The social distance of 2 metres helps avoid the blast radius, and mandating the use of masks is meant to prevent bubble blowing. Mackenzie’s new policies have kept the populace safe from further gum-related injuries for the time being, so they will stay in place as long as the risk of students Blow™-ing each other is present.</p> <p>It is currently unknown why the rest of the world has adopted similar regulations despite the illicit sales only being conducted at Mackenzie. Expert trend analyst Reggie ÜnÜnÜn states, “Mackenzie is simply extremely fashion-forward. The rest of the world must have seen this as a fashionable trend and wanted to stay hip.” While it has yet to be verified, this is the most logical explanation one can assume.</p> </div> <hr> <div id="valentines-day-2" class="article-wrapper"> <h2>Valentine's Day <a class="external-link" href="https://flounder.news/2021/02/valentines-day-2/"> <svg height="1em" width="1em" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 1000 1000" enable-background="new 0 0 1000 1000" xml:space="preserve"> <metadata> Svg Vector Icons : http://www.onlinewebfonts.com/icon </metadata> <g fill="currentColor"><g transform="translate(0.000000,511.000000) scale(0.100000,-0.100000)"><path d="M2921.9,4981.1c-216.4-57.4-408.5-220.8-499.1-424c-35.3-75.1-42-185.5-50.8-947.4l-11-861.3l-861.3-11c-819.3-11-865.7-13.3-960.6-57.4c-159-75.1-278.3-194.3-357.8-357.7l-72.9-148l-6.6-3146.9c-4.4-3142.5-4.4-3146.9,42-3299.3c39.7-132.5,66.3-172.2,183.3-291.5c119.2-117.1,159-143.5,291.5-183.3c152.4-46.4,156.8-46.4,3299.3-41.9l3146.9,6.6l148,72.9c163.4,79.5,282.7,198.8,357.8,357.8c44.2,95,46.4,141.3,57.4,960.6l11,861.3l861.3,11c819.3,11,865.7,13.3,960.6,57.4c159,75.1,278.3,194.3,357.8,357.7l72.9,148l6.6,3146.9c4.4,3142.5,4.4,3146.9-41.9,3299.3c-39.8,132.5-66.3,172.3-183.3,291.5c-117,114.8-161.2,143.5-287.1,183.3c-150.2,46.4-161.2,46.4-3257.3,44.2C3741.2,5009.8,2999.2,5003.2,2921.9,4981.1z M9151.7,1246.8v-3014.4H6137.3H3122.9v3014.4v3014.4h3014.4h3014.4V1246.8z M2372,16.7v-1972.1l64-132.5c75.1-156.8,192.1-280.5,344.5-360l110.4-59.6l1992-6.6l1994.2-4.4v-761.9v-761.9H3862.7H848.3v3014.4v3014.4h761.9H2372V16.7z"></path><path d="M5629.4,3477.2c-300.3-108.2-333.5-519-55.2-682.4c72.9-44.2,117-46.4,792.8-53l715.5-6.6L5887.8,1538.3C5064,712.3,4682,314.8,4657.7,259.6c-46.4-114.8-42-216.4,17.7-326.8c90.5-170,291.5-240.7,474.8-165.6c55.2,24.3,452.7,406.3,1278.7,1230.1l1196.9,1194.7l6.6-715.5c6.6-675.8,8.8-719.9,53-792.8c53-92.8,163.4-170,267.2-189.9c176.7-33.1,377.6,97.2,426.2,273.8c15.5,66.3,22.1,448.3,17.7,1280.9l-6.6,1185.9l-50.8,81.7c-28.7,44.2-88.3,103.8-132.5,132.5l-81.7,50.8l-1203.6,4.4C5923.1,3508.1,5702.2,3503.7,5629.4,3477.2z"></path></g></g> </svg> </a> </h2> <br> <figure> <img src="./February 2021 Issue _ The Flounder_files/2021-02-12-valentines-day-2.png"> </figure> </div> <hr> <div id="detention" class="article-wrapper"> <h2>What are you going to do?

Give me detention?”</p> <p>The teacher was initially flustered, but, after a moment of thought, responded, “Yes.”</p> <p>After class, the teacher held the virtual detention session.</p> <p>“I can’t believe we’re actually doing this,” the student sighed.</p> <p>“Boy, you asked for it,” the teacher responded.</p> <p>Due to this incident, Mackenzie banned virtual detention for the foreseeable future.</p> </div> <hr> <br> <center> <img src="./February 2021 Issue _ The Flounder_files/2021-02-cover-back.png" alt="/assets/img/2021-02-cover-back.png" class="cover-image"> </center> </div> </main> <button class="scroll-to-top" title="Back to Top"> <img alt="Fish" src="./February 2021 Issue _ The Flounder_files/logo.svg"> </button> <footer class="site-footer"> <nav class="footer-nav"> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/">Home</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/about/">About</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://forms.gle/3bvsntMzJKumC4vJ8">Subscribe</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/random/">Random Article</a> </nav> <div class="aux-links"> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/Terms-of-Service/">Terms of Service</a> <a class="page-link" href="https://flounder.news/licenses/">Licenses</a> </div> <div class="socials"> <a class="social-link instagram" href="https://instagram.com/wlmac.floundernews" target="_blank" title="@wlmac.floundernews"></a> <a class="social-link facebook" href="https://facebook.com/macfloundernews" target="_blank" title="macfloundernews"></a> <a class="social-link email" href="mailto:thefloundernews@gmail.com" target="_blank" title="thefloundernews@gmail.com"></a> </div> <p>The Flounder</p> </footer>

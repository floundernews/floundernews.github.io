title: Find what your sleeping position is when you are on vacation in January
description: To be more specific you were on vacation in January and also had a stressful day but are excited for tomorrow because life is not very long and you want to live every day like it is your last but you also understand the repercussions of not planning ahead so you end up saying “live every day like it’s your last” to make you feel better but never act on it and you also ate a great sandwich last Friday but it needed a bit more mayo.

  What the hell are you spending your time on? The fact that you went through this entire quiz means you don’t deserve an answer; go do something with your life. I don’t know what that says about me for writing it, but the point stands. You could be figuring out your blood type or or testing your IQ. Go do something for once.

  - "When the soda can is opened, that changes the system from a closed system to an open one. Since equilibrium is only achieved in a closed system, this disturbs the equilibrium. As gaseous carbon dioxide is produced and released into the surroundings, the reaction continuously shifts to the right to produce more carbon dioxide until all of the carbonic acid has been consumed, causing the soda to go flat. To prevent this, the soda could be cooled, as the forward reaction is endothermic, meaning removing heat from the system will cause it to favour the reverse reaction, causing it to release carbon dioxide at a slower rate. You could also close the soda can.":
